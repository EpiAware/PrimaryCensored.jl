# How Exponentially Tilted Primary Events Affect Observed Delay Distributions

## Introduction

### What are we going to do in this exercise

We'll demonstrate how epidemic growth creates additional bias in observed delay distributions through primary event censoring - distinct from truncation bias. We'll cover:

1. Exponentially tilted vs Uniform primary events
2. Double interval censoring effects
3. Impact on delay distributions

### What might I need to know before starting

This tutorial builds on [Getting Started with CensoredDistributions.jl](@ref getting-started) and focusses on **exponentially tilted primary events** - when primary events occur non-uniformly within observation windows (due here to exponential dynamics).

During epidemic growth/decline, primary events don't occur uniformly within our observation window:
- **Growth phase**: Recent primary events over-represented → shorter observed delays
- **Decline phase**: Older primary events more represented → longer observed delays
- **Steady state**: Uniform timing → minimal additional bias

### Simulated scenarios

We'll examine epidemic phase bias using a realistic scenario:
- **True incubation period**: Gamma(4.0, 1.5) with mean 6.0 days
- **Primary event windows**: 7-day observation periods
- **Growth rate scenarios**: r ∈ {-10%, -5%, 0%, +5%, +10%}

## Part 2: Double Interval Censoring - Primary + Secondary Windows

Now we demonstrate the **double interval censoring** concept: primary events occur within surveillance-defined primary windows, but during epidemics their timing distribution becomes non-uniform (ExponentiallyTilted), then we observe delays within secondary windows (surveillance window minus primary event time). For the secondary even the distribution doesn't impact what we observe (see references for why).

Now we examine how epidemic phase bias affects the delays we might observe. We start with the primary censored delay distributions. Note that most of the time, we won't observe these continuous distributions as the secondary event will also be censored.

## Key Insights

1. **Primary event bias is distinct from truncation bias:**
   - Occurs regardless of the primary event distribution but is more complex when the primary event distribution is non-uniform.
   - Growth phase: Recent primary events over-represented → shorter observed delays
   - Decline phase: Older primary events more represented → longer observed delays

2. **Two key factors control bias magnitude:**
   - **Growth rate magnitude**: Stronger growth (larger |r|) creates more divergence from the uniform case
   - **Window length**: Longer windows increases divergence for same growth rate

3. **When to use `ExponentiallyTilted`:**
   - Most important when primary censoring intervals are wide (multi-day windows)
   - For daily primary censoring and moderate epidemic growth, Uniform distributions are often a reasonable approximation
   - Key benefit of Uniform: Analytical solutions available that are much faster computationally
   - Use `ExponentiallyTilted` when precision is critical, the computational cost is acceptable, and the growth rate is relatively well known.
