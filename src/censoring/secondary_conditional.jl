"""
The distribution of the observed time under a `double_interval_censored`
pipeline given a realised primary `p`: the continuous total `p + delay`
truncated to `[lower, upper]` and interval-censored on the absolute grid. Scored
with `logpdf`/`rand` (no closed-form `cdf`/`quantile`) and normalised by the
pipeline truncation constant so the joint over `p` integrates to the analytic
`double_interval_censored` marginal. A `nothing` `interval` is the
truncated-only continuous case.

Fields `delay`, `primary_event`, `lower`, `upper`, `interval`, `p`. Always
carries a truncation or an interval; the bare untruncated case is a
`_ShiftedDelayCore` instead.
