Latent-variable wrapper turning a primary-censored delay into its latent
representation, sampling the primary event time rather than integrating it out.

A latent primary-censored delay is multivariate over the event times
`[primary, observed]`: the primary event time is a sampled latent variable
rather than integrated out. `rand` produces `[primary, observed]` and
`logpdf([primary, observed])` is the primary prior plus the conditional of the
observed time given the primary.

Marginal versus latent is dispatch on the type: the plain
[`PrimaryCensored`](@ref) is the univariate marginal default, and wrapping it in
`Latent` selects the latent representation. Construct via [`latent`](@ref).

The `dist` field holds the wrapped primary-censored distribution.

Turn a primary-censored distribution into its latent representation.

Returns a [`Latent`](@ref) multivariate distribution over `[primary, observed]`.
A draw is a labelled `NamedTuple` `(primary = ..., observed = ...)`.

# Arguments
- `d`: A primary-censored distribution (for example from
  [`primary_censored`](@ref)).

# Examples
```@example
using CensoredDistributions, Distributions

d = primary_censored(LogNormal(1.5, 0.75), Uniform(0, 1))
ld = latent(d)
rand(ld)
```

# See also
- [`marginal`](@ref): the inverse, recovering the wrapped marginal
  distribution.

@doc "

Recover the marginal distribution a [`latent`](@ref) wraps (the inverse of
`latent`).

`marginal(d)` is the inverse of [`latent`](@ref): it unwraps a [`Latent`](@ref)
back to the marginal distribution it carries, so `marginal(latent(d)) == d`. It
is idempotent, so a distribution that is not a `Latent` is returned unchanged,
giving
`marginal(d) == d` and `marginal(marginal(x)) == marginal(x)`. Use it to move
from the per-event latent view back to the collapsed marginal observed view.

# Arguments
- `d`: A [`Latent`](@ref) to unwrap, or any distribution (returned unchanged).

# Examples
```@example
using CensoredDistributions, Distributions

d = primary_censored(LogNormal(1.5, 0.75), Uniform(0, 1))
marginal(latent(d)) == d
```

Log density of a [`latent`](@ref) distribution over a vector argument, in two
forms selected by the `primary` keyword.

Without `primary`, the vector `x` is a single scored joint record
`[primary, observed]` and the result is the joint log density, the primary prior
density plus the [`PrimaryConditional`](@ref) of the observed time given the
primary, `logpdf(get_primary_event(d), p) + logpdf(PrimaryConditional(d, p), y)`.
The labelled `NamedTuple` `(primary = ..., observed = ...)` is also accepted and
converted internally.

With a `primary` vector, `x` is a vector of observed times and the result is the
*batched* conditional log density: each observed time is scored against its own
primary for the single distribution and the per-record log densities are summed,
in one vectorised pass, so `logpdf(latent(d), ys; primary = ps)` scores a whole
vector of records in place of a per-record loop. `ys` and `primary` must have
equal length. Each record is
truncated below by its own primary (see [`get_primary_event`](@ref)); a record
whose primary falls at or after its whole interval is infeasible and contributes
`-Inf`. This scales the latent form to many records; the marginal is the separate
[`PrimaryCensored`](@ref) default, recovered by `marginal(d)`.

Scalar observed density / tail / quantile of a [`latent`](@ref) distribution,
conditional on a primary event.

These scalar accessors are the latent conditional form. With a primary
passed (`logpdf(d, y; primary = p)`) the call is the deterministic
[`PrimaryConditional`](@ref)`(d, p)` kernel; with no primary one is Monte-Carlo
sampled from [`get_primary_event`](@ref)`(d)` and conditioned on, a stochastic
single-draw estimate. The integrating marginal is the separate
[`PrimaryCensored`](@ref), recovered via [`marginal`](@ref).

Moments of a [`latent`](@ref) distribution as the length-2 vector over its
`[primary, observed]` marginals, covering `mean`, `var`, `std` and `median`.

The primary component is the closed-form moment of the primary event
distribution [`get_primary_event`](@ref). The observed component is the censored
observed marginal [`marginal`](@ref): its `median` is the numeric marginal
median, and because it has no closed-form mean or variance its `mean`/`var` are a
fixed-seed Monte Carlo estimate (deterministic and reproducible). `std` is the
elementwise square root of `var`.

The per-primary conditional accessors (`quantile(d, q; primary)` and the scalar
density/tail) are the separate conditional view.
