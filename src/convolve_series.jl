Convolve a timeseries with a continuous delay, discretised by double
interval censoring.

`convolve_series(d, series)` for a continuous `d` wraps it with
[`double_interval_censored`](@ref) and convolves `series` with the resulting
grid PMF. `interval` sets the grid step and defaults to 1, so `series` entry
`i` is read at time `(i - 1) * interval`. Any other keyword arguments pass
through to [`double_interval_censored`](@ref), so the primary event,
truncation, and solver can be set.

A continuous delay carries no mass on the lag grid until it is discretised,
and the discretisation is a censoring choice; this method makes the usual
epidemiological choice for you. Pass a pre-built censored delay to control
it exactly.

# Examples
```@example
using CensoredDistributions, ConvolvedDistributions, Distributions

infections = [0.0, 1.0, 3.0, 6.0, 8.0, 5.0, 2.0]
expected_counts = convolve_series(LogNormal(1.5, 0.75), infections)
```

Convolve a timeseries with an interval-censored delay PMF on the delay's
own grid.

Reads the discretised delay PMF off the regular-grid interval-censored
distribution `d` (e.g. the return of `double_interval_censored(dist;
interval = w)`) and returns the causal discrete convolution of `series`
with it. `series` is read on the same grid `d` discretises onto: entry `i`
is the value at time `(i - 1) * w`.

Arbitrary-boundary interval-censored distributions are rejected: the causal
convolution needs a single fixed grid step to shift by.

# Examples
```@example
using CensoredDistributions, ConvolvedDistributions, Distributions

delay = double_interval_censored(LogNormal(1.5, 0.75); interval = 7)
infections = [0.0, 1.0, 3.0, 6.0, 8.0, 5.0, 2.0]
expected_counts = convolve_series(delay, infections)

Reject a bare primary-censored delay in `convolve_series`.

A [`primary_censored`](@ref) distribution is still continuous.
ConvolvedDistributions' `convolve_series` is discrete-only, so this throws
an `ArgumentError` directing the caller to add an explicit secondary
interval censoring step first, e.g. `double_interval_censored(dist;
interval = w)`.
