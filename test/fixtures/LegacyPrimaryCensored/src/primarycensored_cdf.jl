Function factory for optimized Weibull g function.

Creates a specialized function with pre-computed constants for g(t; k, λ) = γ(1 + 1/k, (t/λ)^k)
where γ is the lower incomplete gamma function.

Pre-computes `inv_k = 1/k` and `a = 1 + inv_k` to avoid repeated computation
in the returned specialized function.

# Arguments
- `k::Real`: Weibull shape parameter
- `λ::Real`: Weibull scale parameter

# Returns
A specialized function `weibull_g_specialized(t::Real)` that efficiently computes
the Weibull g function using pre-computed constants.

# Examples
```julia
weibull_g_func = _make_weibull_g(2.0, 1.5)
g_val = weibull_g_func(3.0)
```

Compute the CDF of a primary event censored distribution.

Dispatches to either analytical or numerical implementation based on the solver method.
Analytical solutions are available for specific distribution pairs with Uniform primary events.
Use `methods(primarycensored_cdf)` to see all available analytical implementations.

For distribution pairs without analytical solutions, numerical integration is used automatically
when called with an `AnalyticalSolver`. Use `NumericSolver` to force numerical integration
even when analytical solutions exist (useful for testing and validation).

# Arguments
- `dist`: The delay distribution from primary event to observation
- `primary_event`: The primary event time distribution
- `x`: Evaluation point for the CDF
- `method`: Solver method (`AnalyticalSolver` or `NumericSolver`)

# Returns
The cumulative probability P(X ≤ x) where X is the observed delay time.

# Examples
```@example
using CensoredDistributions, Distributions

# Analytical solution for Gamma with Uniform primary event. The default
# `GaussLegendre` solver is the numeric fallback.
gamma_dist = Gamma(2.0, 1.5)
primary_uniform = Uniform(0, 2)
analytical_method = AnalyticalSolver()

# Force numerical integration
numeric_method = NumericSolver()
cdf_numeric = primarycensored_cdf(gamma_dist, primary_uniform, 3.0, numeric_method)

algorithm (e.g. `NumericSolver(QuadGKJL())`).

Direct CDF form of the primary-event-censored distribution **when the
primary event distribution is `Uniform`**. The ``1/w_P`` normalisation drops
out cleanly because ``f_U = 1/w_P`` is constant over the support; non-Uniform
primaries do not produce this closed form and must be handled separately.

Derived by integration by parts on the partial expectation:

```math
F_{S+}(d) = \\frac{d \\, F_T(d) - q \\, F_T(q) - (M_T(d) - M_T(q))}{w_P}
```

where ``d = x - u_{\\min}``, ``q = \\max(d - w_P, 0)``, ``w_P`` is the primary
window width, ``F_T`` is the delay CDF, and ``M_T(t) = \\int_0^t u \\, f_T(u) \\, du``
is the partial first moment of the delay.

This helper is the shared arithmetic shape of the three built-in analytical
pairs (Gamma / LogNormal / Weibull + Uniform) and is exposed as public (but
not exported) API so that downstream code can add its own
`primarycensored_cdf(::MyDelay, ::Uniform, x, ::AnalyticalSolver)` method
without re-deriving the formula. Supply ``M_T`` in whatever closed form the
delay distribution admits - for the built-ins:

- Gamma: ``M_T(t) = k\\theta \\cdot F_T(t; k+1, \\theta)``.
- LogNormal: ``M_T(t) = e^{\\mu + \\sigma^2/2} \\cdot F_T(t; \\mu + \\sigma^2, \\sigma)``.
- Weibull: ``M_T(t) = \\lambda \\cdot \\gamma(1 + 1/k, (t/\\lambda)^k)``.

When `q` is clamped to 0 (i.e. ``d \\le w_P``), pass `F_T_q = 0` and
`M_T_q = 0`; both terms drop out cleanly.

# Arguments

- `d::Real`: Primary-event-adjusted evaluation point (`x - u_{min}`).
- `q::Real`: Lower integration endpoint, `max(d - w_P, 0)`.
- `F_T_d::Real`: Delay CDF at `d`, `F_T(d)`.
- `F_T_q::Real`: Delay CDF at `q`, `F_T(q)` (pass `0` when `q = 0`).
- `M_T_d::Real`: Partial first moment at `d`, `M_T(d)`.
- `M_T_q::Real`: Partial first moment at `q`, `M_T(q)` (pass `0` when `q = 0`).
- `pwindow::Real`: Primary window width `w_P`.

# Returns

The primary-censored CDF `F_{S+}(x)`.

# Example

Reproduces the built-in Gamma analytical pair from first principles:

Analytical CDF for Gamma delay with Uniform primary event distribution.

[primarycensored R package](https://primarycensored.epinowcast.org/articles/analytic-solutions.html)

``F_T(\\cdot; k+1, \\theta)`` is obtained from ``F_T(\\cdot; k, \\theta)`` via the
recursion ``P(k+1, y) = P(k, y) - y^k e^{-y} / \\Gamma(k+1)``, halving the
number of hypergeometric evaluations. `y^k` and `inv(Γ(k+1))` are shared
between ``F_T`` and ``M_T`` at each endpoint.
