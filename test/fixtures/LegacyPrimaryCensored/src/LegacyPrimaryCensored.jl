# LegacyPrimaryCensored: a self-contained, verbatim snapshot of the
# pre-ConvolvedDistributions primary-censoring implementation, used as an
# oracle by the delegation harness (`test/delegation/PrimaryCensored_delegation.jl`)
# during the refactor that reimplemented `CensoredDistributions.PrimaryCensored`
# as a thin wrapper over `ConvolvedDistributions.Convolved`.
#
# The module deliberately exports NOTHING and keeps every name internal
# (non-colliding) so a harness that does `using CensoredDistributions,
# LegacyPrimaryCensored` never hits a name ambiguity with the production
# package's `primary_censored`/`PrimaryCensored`/`AnalyticalSolver`/
# `NumericSolver`/`GaussLegendre`. The harness reaches them qualified, and
# the one public-ish alias the harness calls (`legacy_primary_censored`) is
# deliberately kept out of `export`.
