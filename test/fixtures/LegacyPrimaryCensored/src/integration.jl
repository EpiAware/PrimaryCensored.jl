# Pluggable numerical integration.
#
# Every integral in the package routes through `integrate`, which
# dispatches on the solver type. The package ships one lightweight default
# solver, `GaussLegendre`, implemented directly with `FastGaussQuadrature`
# nodes (no heavy dependency). Loading the optional Integrals.jl extension
# adds an `integrate` method for any Integrals.jl algorithm
# (e.g. `QuadGKJL()`, `HCubatureJL()`), so a user can pass an Integrals.jl
# solver and have that integral routed through `IntegralProblem`/`solve`.
# See https://github.com/EpiAware/CensoredDistributions.jl/issues/208.

Fixed-node Gauss-Legendre quadrature solver (the package default).

Integrates with a Gauss-Legendre rule of `n` nodes, evaluated as a bare
weighted dot product (see [`gl_integrate`](@ref)). The constant control
flow and the accumulator type being seeded from the integrand make this
the AD-safe default: every supported AD backend can differentiate through
it, unlike adaptive schemes whose node count depends on integrand values.

The reference nodes and weights are built once at construction and held on
the solver, so the differentiated hot path is a pure weighted sum with no
shared mutable state. This matters for trace-based reverse-mode backends
(Enzyme, ReverseDiff): resolving the rule through a mutated global cache
inside the integrand crashes Enzyme reverse, so the rule travels with the
solver instead.

`n = 64` is accurate to about `1e-13` on the smooth, density-weighted
integrands used in this package. This is the core default and needs no
heavy dependency. Load Integrals.jl and pass an Integrals.jl algorithm
(e.g. `QuadGKJL()`) when adaptive accuracy is wanted and AD is not.

# component density (e.g. LogNormal) makes this the accuracy-limiting

# ~5e-4 (n = 64 left it at ~4e-3) and shrinks it ~15x on a deliberately

Integrate a scalar function `f` over `[lo, hi]` by fixed-node
Gauss-Legendre quadrature.

The reference domain `[-1, 1]` is mapped onto `[lo, hi]` inside the
integrand and the result reduced as a weighted dot product, so the
accumulator's element type is taken from the integrand and AD `Dual`s and
tangents propagate. Returns a typed zero when `hi <= lo`.

# Arguments
- `f`: The scalar integrand.
- `lo`: Lower integration bound.
- `hi`: Upper integration bound.
- `rule`: Gauss-Legendre rule to use (default: the 192-node convolution
  rule).

# Examples
```@example
using CensoredDistributions

# Integrate x^2 over [0, 1] (exact value 1/3)
approx = CensoredDistributions.gl_integrate(x -> x^2, 0.0, 1.0)
```

Integrate a scalar function `f` over `[lower, upper]` using `solver`.

This is the pluggable integration entry point: every integral in the
package calls `integrate`, dispatching on the solver type. The default
[`GaussLegendre`](@ref) solver routes to [`gl_integrate`](@ref). Loading
the optional Integrals.jl extension adds a method for Integrals.jl
algorithms (e.g. `QuadGKJL()`), which builds an `IntegralProblem` and
calls `solve`.

# Arguments
- `solver`: The integration backend. `GaussLegendre` by default; any
  Integrals.jl algorithm when that extension is loaded.
- `f`: The scalar integrand.
- `lower`: Lower integration bound.
- `upper`: Upper integration bound.

# Examples
```@example
using CensoredDistributions

solver = CensoredDistributions.GaussLegendre(; n = 64)
approx = CensoredDistributions.integrate(solver, x -> x^2, 0.0, 1.0)
```
