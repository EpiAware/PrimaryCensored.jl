    ADFixtures

Shared AD gradient scenarios and backend metadata for CensoredDistributions.
Used by `test/ad/runtests.jl`, `benchmark/src/ad_gradients.jl`, and the
docs tutorial `docs/src/getting-started/tutorials/ad-backends.jl`.

The reference gradient is computed with `ForwardDiff`. `PrimaryCensored.logpdf`
internally finite-differences the CDF with a hardcoded step `h=1e-8`, which
defeats adaptive finite-difference references (e.g. `central_fdm(5, 1)`
disagrees with all AD backends by ~10% on Weibull analytical scenarios).
ForwardDiff's Dual-number propagation through that internal FD gives the
exact derivative of the package's own logpdf and matches every other working
backend (ReverseDiff, Mooncake reverse/forward) to ~1e-6.
